# *Journey...*

The app was initially planned for a school project. Later as many new features were added into it, it was planned to publish it as a mobile app. The app was built using Python, Kivy and KivyMD frameworks.
It took about 10 months to learn the frameworks needed to build the app and finally the source code will be released online.
